#' @title Compile a Stan model and return a path to the compiled model output.
#' @description We return the paths to the Stan model specification
#'   and the compiled model file so `targets` can treat them as
#'   dynamic files and compile the model if either file changes.
#' @return Path to the compiled Stan model, which is just an RDS file.
#'   To run the model, you can read this file into a new R session with
#'   `readRDS()` and feed it to the `object` argument of `sampling()`.
#' @param model_file Path to a Stan model file.
#'   This is a text file with the model spceification.
#' @examples
#' library(cmdstanr)
#' compile_model("stan/model.stan")
